            <li><b>1941 </b>- Tries to enroll in the military after the pearl habor attack, but <br>
                is rejected. Instead, the military asks his lab to work on waterproof <br>
                glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants and other applied <br>science.</li>
            <li><b>1942 </b>- Receives a PHD in Genetics and plant Pathology.</li>
            <li><b>1944 </b>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br>
                pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology <br>
                program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different <br>
                strains of disease resistent-wheat, including different varieties for <br>
            each major climate on earth.  </li>
            <li><b>1945 </b>- Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling <br>
                wheat yields..</li>
            <li><b>1953 </b>- crosses a short, study darf yield of wheat, with a high-<br>
                yielding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to <br>
                fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of mexico's wheat..</li>
            <li><b>1962 </b>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the <br>
                indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a <br>
                rapidly expanding population.</li>
            <li><b>1970 </b>- Receives the Nobel Peace Prize.</li>
            <li><b>1983 </b>- Helps seven african countries dramatically increase their <br>

            <li><b>2005 </b>- states "We will have to double the world food supply by 2050."<br>
            argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can <br>
        meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops <br>
        that are inherently dangerous because " we have been genetically <br>
        modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called <br>
        it science, people were seleting the best breeds."
